# Comments from original version

# Kay Diederichs 10/2015
# 3/2017 include RAMdisk creation for MacOS; only lightly tested!
# 3/2016 adapt for eiger2cbf and hdf2mini-cbf
# for the latter see https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ccp4bb;58a4ee1.1603 and
# https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ccp4bb;a048b4e8.1603 
#
# Idea: put temporary files into fast local directory, instead of NFS
#
# Installation: Rename Dectris' H5ToXds to H5ToXds.bin
#               This script should be called H5ToXds and reside in $PATH 
#               Modify this script according to which binary you use - see comments below.
#
# Recommendation:
# - for the fast local directory one should use a RAMdisk (one GB size at most)
# - /dev/shm seems to be already set up for that purpose on most Linux distributions
# - on MacOS you can easily set this up as described at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2033362/does-os-x-have-an-equivalent-to-dev-shm
# example on MacOS for 1GB RAMdisk (needs to be repeated after booting):
# diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ RAMdisk $(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$((2 * 1024 * 1000)))

# Comments for revision NSLS-II MX version
# H. J. Bernstein 5/2018
#
# This is a modified version of H5ToXds being incorporated
# with permission from Kay Diederichs within the open source 
# github nsls-ii-mx fast_dp kit, forked from the original DLS 
# github fast_dp
#
# This version assumes that you either have a working H5ToXds.bin
# in your path, or have defined H5TOXDS_PATH to be the path of
# a suitable alternative, such as eiger2cbf
#
# ================================================================================
#
# on MacOS the next line should then be:
# tempfile="/Volumes/RAMdisk/H5ToXds${PWD//\//_}.$3"
# and on Linux:
tempfile="/dev/shm/H5ToXds${PWD//\//_}.$3"

# choose between H5ToXds.bin,  eiger2cbf and hdf2mini-cbf; un/comment accordingly
# or define the environment variable H5TOXDSPATH appropriately
